The Typical Meteorological Year (TMY) data is a derivative created by AREMI and based on the Bureau of Meteorology One Minute Solar data. The One Minute Solar data was processed using the aremi-tmy tool, due to be Open Sourced soon at the following URL:

As part of the processing an intermediate more complete timeseries output is created, referred to as the Solar Station Historical Observation (SSHO) data, which is also available on AREMI. The SSHO was generated by placing the Bureau One Minute Solar data values into hourly buckets, and calculating the arithmetic mean per hour. Any data gaps of less than 5 hours were linearly interpolated (by individual field, e.g. missing temperature data is treated independently from other fields which may or may not also be missing). Following the 5 hour interpolation, gaps of 24 hours or less are filled by using data from the same time in the previous or next day. Gaps larger than this were ignored and are therefore still present in the SSHO. As a result of this processing, this is a more complete dataset compared to the One Minute Solar data, but with less resolution.
<p>
After the One Minute Solar data has been processed into the SSHO timeseries, further processing takes place to analyse the separate months of timeseries data to determine the &quot;most typical&quot; months. This analysis is based on the Sandia Method as detailed by S. Wilcox and W. Marion in <a target='_blank' href='http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy08osti/43156.pdf'>'Users Manual for TMY3 Data Sets', NREL</a>.
<p>
In order to generate a TMY for a station it is a requirement that at least one of the calendar months has data from at least 9 different years.

The TMY data available here was processed using the aremi-tmy version 0.1.1.0 tool from the source Bureau One Minute Solar data. Start dates for the Bureau's One Minute Solar data and the period over which stations have made solar observations vary significantly. The first sites began recording solar data in 1993, while the most recently opened sites commenced in 2012. Some stations are now closed. The number of years of data recorded can be accessed by clicking on the station to display the site data.
