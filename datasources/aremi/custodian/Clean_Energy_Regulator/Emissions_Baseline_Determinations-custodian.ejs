The Clean Energy Regulator is the Government body responsible for administering legislation that will reduce carbon emissions and increase the use of clean energy.
<br/>
The Clean Energy Regulator was established on 2 April 2012 as an independent statutory authority by the <a href='http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2011A00163'>Clean Energy Regulator Act 2011</a> and operates as part of the <a href='https://www.environment.gov.au/'>Environment portfolio</a>. The role of the Clean Energy Regulator is determined by climate change law. The schemes administered by the Clean Energy Regulator work together to reduce emissions while encouraging business competiveness.
</br>
The Clean Energy Regulator’s purpose is to accelerate carbon abatement for Australia. Everything the Clean Energy Regulator does is connected to measuring, managing, reducing or offsetting Australia’s carbon emissions.
