By 28 February each year, the Clean Energy Regulator publishes a point-in-time extract of scope 1 and scope 2 emissions and electricity production data specific to the electricity sector. This particular data set relates to the electricity sector data for the 2015-16 National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting year.
<br/><br/>
<strong>Designated generation facility:</strong> A designated generation facility, is a facility where the principle activity is electricity production. Facilities that generate electricity for their own use or as a secondary activity are not considered a designated generation facility and therefore not included in this publication.
