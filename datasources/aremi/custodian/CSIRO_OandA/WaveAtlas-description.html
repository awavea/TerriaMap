<p>Led by CSIRO Oceans and Athmosphere, the Atlas provides a 4D interactive wave map of the greater Australian coastal area relative to available infrastructure and spatial constraints in the marine domain. The project was partly funded by the Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) and was built on earlier CSIRO assessments of Australia's wave energy resources. The Atlas makes it easier to assess the feasibility of wave power projects. The online Atlas has used data from weather mapping, satellites, measuring stations and a variety of other sources, which have been fed into a complex wave modelling application.

<p>
The main findings of the research illustrated by the Atlas show that the potential for wave energy in Australia is great:
<ul>
<li>the preliminary studies show the southern coastline of Australia has a great wave resource. This is because strong Southern Ocean winds generate consistently large waves which travel northwards to Australia's southern coastline. The large consistent swell provides ideal conditions for wave energy production.</li>
<li>the research shows wave energy could contribute up to 11% of Australia's energy (enough energy to power a city the size of Melbourne) by 2050.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
The online Atlas has 3 main components:
<ol>
<li>Analysis Study Area - which highlights the area where it is possible to use the analytical functions of the Atlas;</li>
<li>Analysis Tools - which include processes that are operated on wave data;</li>
<li>Wave Model and Context Layers - which contains the wave model layers and other layers that can be used for decisions related to wave energy devices. This group includes geographic information on marine usage, such as Fisheries and Shipping.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
Below are the steps to access and query the Atlas information:
<ul>
<li>Click on 'Analysis Tools' and then scroll down to select a type of analysis;</li>
<li>Once the type of analysis has been selected, to enable a query, a location needs to be selected; either by clicking on point within the 'Analysis Study Area' highlighted in grey or by typing the exact lat/long;</li>
<li>Once the location point has been selected, click on 'Run Analysis'; an image with the analysis results will appear in the workbench.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Additional data - context layers
<ul>
<li>accessing context layers can be done without activating the Analysis Study Area nor selecting an analysis from the Analysis Tools;</li>
<li>this category includes information about usage of marine environment (fisheries, pollution, shipping etc.) and wave energy resources (wave power, wave energy flux, wave height etc.)</li>
</ul>
