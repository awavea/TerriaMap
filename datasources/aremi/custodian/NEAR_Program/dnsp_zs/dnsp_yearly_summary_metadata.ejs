        Here we present yearly summaries of Zone Substation Load Data, including estimated total active energy, maximum and minimum supply, and standard deviation of interval measurements. </p>

        <p class='csiro-near-p'>
        The dataset spans the year range 2003 to 2018. An individual DNSP or zone substation may not have data available for every year in this range. This is indicated by a grey colouring on the map. A zone substation may not have data for a complete year. This can be determined by the Start and End Delivery Time. The summary statistics are calculated between between Start and End Delivery Time for the specified calendar year.  Where data was provided in apparent power units, a simple conversion to real power units was applied, assuming a constant power factor of 0.9. </p>
