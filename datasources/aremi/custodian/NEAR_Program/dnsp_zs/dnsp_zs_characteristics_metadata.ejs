      Here we present a characterisation of Zone Substations in terms of Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) Mesh Block (MB) land use categories, dwellings and persons. Areal interpolation has been used to reaggregate data from the ABS Mesh Block geometry to the Zone Substation geometry, using the intersection of polygons. This method has a number of limitations: </p>

      <ul class='csiro-near-ul'>
        <li><strong>Assumption of distribution: </strong>MBs areas are small, but there may be instances where a MB intersects with multiple Zone Substations. Statistics have been calculated using the proportionality of the area of intersection. This may not reflect the physical distribution, such as the location of dwellings and persons.</li>
        <li><strong>Accuracy of spatial data: </strong>The ABS geometry is generally accurate than the DNSP geometry.</li>
      </ul>
