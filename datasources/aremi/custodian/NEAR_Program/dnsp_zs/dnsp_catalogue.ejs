        The National Energy Analytics Research (NEAR) Program has brought together up to a decade of half-hourly electricity consumption data for more than one thousand zone substations across Australiaâ€™s electricity distribution systems. Including data that has never before been publicly released, the zone substation dataset is a rich view into the longitudinal load consumption behaviour of Australian electricity users. The data is presented in a consistent format across distribution businesses and available for free on the <a href=https://near.csiro.au>NEAR platform</a>.</p>

Distribution Network Service Providers make no warranty or guarantee as to the quality, accuracy or suitability for any particular purpose of the zone substation information.  </p>
