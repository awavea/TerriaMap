Grape marc volumes have been estimated by using a conversion factor from the amounts that are listed as crushed in publicly available documents.  Grape marc volumes from crushed grapes can vary greatly, and a range of13 â€“ 35% has been cited in the literature.  For this data we have used a conversion factor of 20% wet weight based on the following publications (Corbin et al., 2015; Ky and Teissedre, 2015; Mazza and Francis, 1995).

Crushed grape volumes are reported in broad categories and as a result volumes of grape marc that are actually produced may vary from what is reported. However, data should give a good indication of what is available at each location.
