    "content": "This data has been modelled to represent the total estimate biomass yields from major agricultural sectors. ABS land use and socio-economic data is available at a range of levels. At the mesh block level, the area covered by the block is nominated into 6 broad land uses, of which Parkland and Agricultural have been extracted. At an SA1 level, more detailed land use data is available, with the % area covered by each of 26 Dynamic Land Covers (DLCs), of which Trees Closed, Irrigated Cropping, Irrigated Pastures and Rainfed Cropping have been extracted. Representative biomass yields for each of these DLCs have been obtained from an analysis of literature and industry contacts (including reviewing relevant datasets provided through ABARES), to determine the total biomass residue production and therefore potentially available at an SA2 level.\n\nThis methodology will be updated to include more recent data and to cover more specific waste types, as more information is uncovered and survey data is collected."
