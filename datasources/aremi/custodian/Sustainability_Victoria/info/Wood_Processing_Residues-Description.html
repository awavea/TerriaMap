Sawmill residues were estimated at an LGA level using forest product data for native forests and plantations, spatial data showing locations of plantations, regional data on wood production from native forests, wood density data and sawmill residue.
<p>
Production of sawlogs and sawn timber for the whole of Victoria was sourced from ABARES (2016a) for native forests (covering the period 2011-15) and from ABARES (2016b) for plantations (covering the period 2016-2020).  The reason for the later time period used for plantation log supply was the sharp increase in plantation log production over time.
Since many sawlogs produced from Victorian forests are processed in other states or exported overseas, the proportion of residues processed in Victoria was estimated from the ratio between total amount of sawn timber produced across the state for the period 2011-15 and the expected total production of sawn timber from plantations and native forests over the same period based on the total number of sawlogs produced and sawn timber recovery rates (Gavran 2014).  This statewide data was distributed at an LGA level using spatial data showing the locations of plantations (ABARES 2016b) and regional production data provided by Vicforests (M. Lawrence Pers. Comm.).

Total sawmill residues were estimated from the number of sawlogs processed using results Gavran et al. (2014) and were converted from volumes to dry mass using wood densities sourced from Illic et al. (2000).  These totals were divided into the following residue categories using proportions estimated by Greaves and May (2014):
<ul>
<li>Woodchips</li>
<li>Sawdust and shavings</li>
<li>Bark</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that most sawmill residues are currently utilised. Wood chips are mostly used for pulp and paper production (either locally or exported overseas), sawdust and shavings are burnt for heat production to kiln dry timber, and bark and sawdust are sold for potting mix or animal bedding.
