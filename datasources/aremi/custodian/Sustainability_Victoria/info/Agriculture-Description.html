The core dataset used in determining baseline production quantities for the primary production sector is the ABS Agricultural Commodities datasets. ABS data has been used from 2010-11 to 2015-16, to provide a time-series average of production from a variety of agricultural commodities.
<p>
Residue factors were applied to the six year average production values based on desktop research and industry consultation and feedback. This includes the following:
<ul>
<li>Cereals – straw and chaff</li>
<li>Non-Cereals – oilseed pods</li>
<li>Cull Fruit</li>
<li>Cull Vegetable</li>
<li>Dairy Manure</li>
<li>Piggery Manure</li>
<li>Poultry Litter</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The results provide estimations of residue quantities generated based on a six-year average of primary production data.
