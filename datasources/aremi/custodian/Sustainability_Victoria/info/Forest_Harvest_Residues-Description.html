This data has been modelled to represent the total estimated forestry residues from Victorian softwood (Pinus radiata) and hardwood (Eucalyptus globulus) plantations at Local Government Area (LGA) level.  Forestry residue dry mass was estimated from data on sawlog and pulp log production available from ABARES (2016a) and spatial data on showing plantation areas obtained from ABARES (2016b).  Because the number of logs harvested from hardwood plantations has been increasing substantially over time, data for future log production (2016-20) was used.
<p>
Log production is available only at a state or regional level.  So, to estimate forestry residue amounts at an LGA level, the area of hardwood and softwood plantations at an LGA level was used with the assumption that the number of logs produced was the same for each hectare of plantation.  To convert wood volumes to dry mass, wood density estimates (Illic, et al.2000) for P.radiata and E. globulus were used.

<p>
Residue amounts were estimated by applying residue factors derived from Ximenes et al. (2008), Greaves & May (2012) and information provided by various plantation growers for softwood and hardwood species.  Residues were separated into the following categories:
<ul>
<li>Stump</li>
<li>Bark</li>
<li>Branches (>5 cm)</li>
<li>Twigs (< 5 cm) branches and foliage (all assumed to be left on site)</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
A proportion of each residue type (ranging from 0% for stumps to 100% for small branches and foliage) was assumed to be unavailable due to difficulty in collection and/or the need to conserve nutrients on site.
