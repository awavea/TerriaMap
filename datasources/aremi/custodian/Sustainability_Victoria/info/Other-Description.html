Organic waste (organics being food, garden and timber wastes and paper and cardboard) generated from the Commercial & Industrial (C&I) waste stream in Victoria was modelled using industry reports and ABS data. The data in this folder excludes the manufacturing and agricultural sectors, which were considered separately.
<p>
The Australian and New Zealand Standard Industrial Classification (ANZSIC) system was used as the basis for categorising and defining the C&I sector in terms of organics waste generation. The ANZSIC system provides a framework for organising data about business types. It provides a standard framework under which units carrying out similar productive activities can be grouped together, with each resultant group being referred to as an industry. There is a total of 19 classes, with each individual class defined in terms of a specified range of activities. The numbering system adopted in the ANZSIC system is a combination of letter characters and numeric coding and has a hierarchical structure, where the leading character denotes the industry division. A total of 12 classes were considered through this modelling.

In the absence of local data providing waste generation or compositional breakdown at ANZSIC division level, a desktop study was conducted to find comparable baseline statistics. Waste generation rates per full time equivalent (FTE) employee for each ANZSIC industry division in the Victorian commercial and industrial sector have been sourced from the Sustainable Resource Use (SRU, 2013) report prepared for Sustainability Victoria. Compositional waste stream data for each ANZSIC industry division have been sourced from the NSW EPA (2015) publication, ‘Pilot generator site-based audit, commercial and Industrial waste stream in the metropolitan levy areas of New South Wales’, and details have been provided in the biomass description field.
The Department of Employment publishes total employment figures by industry division at SA4 level, through the Labour Market Information Portal (LMIP). This data is collected through the ABS quarterly labour force surveys. This employment data was disaggregated using the ABS publication ‘8165.0 Counts of Australian Businesses, Including Entries and Exists (CABEE), June 2013 to June 2017’, which provides estimates of the number of businesses of each industry division at LGA equivalent level across Victoria.

<p>
Using the SRU Victorian waste generation rates, ABS labour count and business information and NSW compositional audit data, estimates of total organics and paper cardboard generation from 12 ANZSIC industry divisions has been modelled.
The results provide estimations of residue quantities based on business counts in 2016-17.
