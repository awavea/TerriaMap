The MSW organics data has been presented for the organics (garden mostly, although some select councils in Victoria operate food and garden organic (FOGO) systems) and paper and cardboard streams at LGA level. Only organics that are landfilled have been presented (compared to other streams where generation has been presented). This is due to the fact that most MSW organics are tied up in long term contract and presenting generation would be an unrealistic presentation of this stream (although noting that energy from MSW organics could be a higher order use than current avenues in some LGAs). The data is raw data obtained from LGAs through the Victorian Local Government Annual Survey (VLGAS) conducted by SV.
