The manufacturing sector (ANZSIC sector C) was considered separately to the other C&I category, with the intention of analysing each individual ANZSIC group within the broader division, which is a significant generator of organic waste. Only those sub-sectors that are significant organic waste generators within the Manufacturing division have been considered. This has been informed through desktop research and targeted consultation to understand the nature and availability of organic wastes produced, including the location of facilities, production size and subsequent residue generation. This includes the following:
<ul>
<li>Cattle processing</li>
<li>Pork processing</li>
<li>Chicken processing</li>
<li>Dairy product processing</li>
<li>Wine production</li>
</ul>
<p>
To determine the locations of major facilities at Local Government Area (LGA) level, the National Pollutant Inventory (NPI) databases were utilised. The NPI Guide Version 6.1, September 2015 provides the overarching requirements for industries and threshold trigger requirements. Most of the facilities within the scope of this assessment produce high strength wastewaters with high nitrogen and phosphorus loadings, which is a trigger that will see their inclusion on the NPI list. Industry-wide generation rates for relevant organic waste streams were derived based on the number of employees, desktop research and consultation with industry.
</p>
<p>
Only those facilities that trigger the requirement for NPI reporting were included.  These were large facilities producing significant quantities of wastewater i.e. organisations employing 200 + staff or large industrial facilities. There is a gap around facilities operated by Small to Medium Enterprises (SMEs), which employ between 20 to 199 staff. This gap has been identified where possible, addressed where enough information has been available, or highlighted as an area of potential further analysis as part of the continuation of this project.

The results provide estimations of residue quantities generated for 2014-15.
