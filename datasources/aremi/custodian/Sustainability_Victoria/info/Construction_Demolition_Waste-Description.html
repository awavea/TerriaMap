The C&D organics data at Waste and Resource Recovery Group (WRRG) level has been presented for the garden and timber organics streams. For all WRRGs the estimated recovery rate for each stream within the C&D sector has been provided in the biomass descriptions. The data has been presented at LGA level, as the WRRGs are not recognised by the AREMI platform. In addition, the data has not been disaggregated to LGA level due to the complexities of modelling C&D wastes at such a level, including that this sector is affected by infrastructure projects and construction activity that is highly variable at a LGA level and cannot be easily correlated to population or employment statistics. Therefore, the figure presented for each LGA is indicative of the total value for the WRRG, and not the specific LGA.
