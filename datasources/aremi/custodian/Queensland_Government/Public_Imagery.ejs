      "content": "The Queensland Imagery (Public) image service displays Landsat 8 imagery over the whole of Queensland, and high resolution imagery, acquired prior to the year 2013, over some areas of the state. The high resolution imagery is that captured under the Spatial Imagery Subscription Plan (SISP) and made available for general use by the Department of Natural Resources and Mines, Queensland. The service uses a map cache currently created for the following scales: 1:2257, 1:4514, 1:9028, 1:18,084, 1:36,112, 1:72,224, 1:144,448, 1:288,895, 1:577,791, 1:1,155,581, 1:2,311,162, 1:4,622,324 and 1:9,244,649. The map service endpoint also displays dynamically to larger scales than those listed. The map cache will be refreshed periodically to show more recent imagery projects as they become available for public use."
