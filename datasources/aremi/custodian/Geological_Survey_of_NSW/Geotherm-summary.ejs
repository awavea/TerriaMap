This raster dataset shows the calculated temperatures of the underlying geology at <%= depth %> depth. The dataset is represented here as a NSW statewide geothermal temperature map at <%= depth %> depth.

The Geological Survey of NSW developed the Geothermal Borehole Database and geothermal 2, 3 and 5km temperature maps in 2015-2016 as part of the renewable energy resource maps for the NSW Renewable Energy Action Plan, Annual Report 2015. The aim of the Geothermal Borehole Database and the renewable energy resource and maps were to;
<p>
(i) Develop an up-to-date NSW borehole temperature database from all available internal and external data sources
(ii) Extrapolate temperature readings from varying depths to 2, 3 and 5km levels using calculations
(iii) Produce statewide temperature maps from the Geothermal Borehole Database for 2, 3 and 5km depths illustrating high and low temperature areas.
