Garrad Hassan Pacific Pty Ltd, trading as DNV GL, was engaged to provide a proposal to the New South Wales Department of Industry. New South Wales Department of Industry requested that DNV GL provide a proposal to undertake wind mapping for the onshore and 250 km offshore of New South Wales (NSW), Australia.
<p>
DNV GL generated a wind speed map covering onshore NSW and approximately 250 km offshore from NSW, in accordance with the Methodology described in the Lineage statement.
<p>
DNV GL considered the most efficient method for covering such a large area within the available budget was to make use of previously generated mesoscale modeling at a horizontal spatial resolution of approximately 5 km. DNV GL then used the mesoscale model outputs to create WAsP Wind Atlas Library (.LIB) files and conduct finer resolution 1 km microscale modelling.
<p>
DNV GL provided the microscale wind speed map across NSW at a horizontal spatial resolution of 1km in a GIS format able to be manipulated by the Department. The wind speed results were provided at one height, 100 metres, above ground level (AGL) specified by the Department.
