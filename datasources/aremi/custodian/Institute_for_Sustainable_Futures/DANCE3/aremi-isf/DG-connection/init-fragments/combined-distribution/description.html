<p>This is a map of ‘Indicative capacity for new generator connections’ determined according to each Network Service Provider’s (NSP) assessment of available capacity available under most conditions for that asset. ‘Most conditions’ is generally representative of ‘system normal’ conditions, where no outages or unusual occurrences are present. Where possible, NSPs have produced these figures giving regard to the factors normally considered in the first pass connection application assessments.</p>

<p>Substations and line assets are mapped and consistently colour coded according to their indicative megawatt (MW) capacity for connection.</p>

<p>A <strong>red to blue colour scale</strong> indicates the connection capacity of that asset where:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Red means there is likely to be little available capacity for new generation without network augmentation.</li>
  <li>Blue indicates that there is likely to be relatively unconstrained capacity for new generation.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Line thickness</strong> is used to show the line voltage:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A thin line indicates a lower voltage line</li>
  <li>A thick line indicates a higher voltage line</li>
</ul>

<p>Where a substation or line asset is grey, no data is available from the NSP on available new generation connection capacity. These may in some cases be private infrastructure.</p>

<p>A legend explaining the various colours and thicknesses is displayed in the left hand pane.</p>

<p>Users should note that indicative new generation capacity estimates have not necessarily considered all technical constraints to which a proposal may be subject. Indications are also subject to change as circumstances change, options are developed and more detailed investigation is done.  Different NSPs use different methods and assess different types of constraints in providing indicative new generation connection capacities and while data suppliers have taken steps towards a consistent approach, the values displayed in one NSP area cannot be assumed to be directly comparable with values in another NSP’s area.</p>

<p>Capacity constraints may exist upstream or downstream of the mapped asset; depending on the NSP's calculation method this may or may not have been considered in this indicative calculation.</p>

<p>This map does NOT show the capacity of the network to accept new loads (see 'Available Distribution Capacity' layer for this data).</p>

<p>When the user clicks on the asset, a range of additional information is shown in a pop up information box. <strong>Many fields of the additional information are optional for an NSP to provide; the user should not expect each NSP layer or each asset to contain all the additional data fields listed.</strong></p>

  </li>
  <li>
    <b>New generation connection capacity available (MW):</b> This is the capacity of the network to accept new generation fed into the system.

Where possible, networks have produced these figures giving regard to the factors normally considered in the first pass connection application assessments.

    <p>For substation assets, connection capacity is calculated at the low side of the transformer.</p>
